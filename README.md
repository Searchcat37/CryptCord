# EncryptCord
BetterDiscord plugin for encrypting &amp; decrypting messages with private key.

## Instructions
1) Replace the key in Encrypt.plugin.js
2) Share this key with another person (preferrably thru another platform so discord doesn't see your messages)
3) Type a message, and to encrypt it just press ALT+Enter and send the message!

## About
Basically I made this to feel more secure on discord as a whole.<br>
NOTE: This is NOT bulletproof encryption! If someone wasted their lives trying to bruteforce it, they could probably eventually get it.

(Obviously) The red text shows that you did not have the correct key to decrypt it, the green text shows that you did.

## Plans
This isnt 100% done at all, I did this real quick in about an hour. I plan to:<br>
1) Make it possibly more secure
2) Make it so you can edit the keys without having to edit the file (via settings or maybe another box on discord)
3) Make it more fleshed out with less errors.

## Known Bugs
* If you just opened discord and you loaded into a channel with encrypted text, it will say CryptoJS is not defined<br>
* If you use "Citador" or another quote based program it tends to show "Malformed UTF-8 Text"
