# EncryptCord
BetterDiscord plugin for encrypting &amp; decrypting messages with private key.

## Instructions
1) Replace the key in Encrypt.plugin.js
2) Share this key with another person (preferrably thru another platform so discord doesn't see your messages)
3) Type a message, and to encrypt it just press ALT+Enter and send the message!

## About
Basically I made this to feel more secure on discord as a whole.<br>
NOTE: This is NOT bulletproof encryption! If someone wasted their lives trying to bruteforce it, they could probably eventually get it.
